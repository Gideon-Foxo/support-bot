<h1 align="center">Discord Support Bot</h1>

A simple yet customizable and powerful lightweight Discord bot to help automate support by helping users get help to easily answered questions. Say good bye to users asking the same question for the 1,000,00th time!

<h1 align="center">Demo!</h1>

Support bot uses a select menu that allows you to setup 25 questions. Because it sends the user a ephemeral message (blue Clyde message) they can look at the question for however long the user needs!

Support bot also allows for native logs. Easily see what questions people ask and keep track of who needs support.
