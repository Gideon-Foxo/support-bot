<h1 align="center">Discord Support Bot</h1>

The Discord Support bot is a bot designed to be simple, lightweight and easy to use to help automate basic and frequently asked questions for support.

<h1 align="center">Demo!</h1>

Here is a gif of a very simple setup using 4 questions and a support responses.

![Its a gif!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713861338673184858/843359915376771122/t6C5hIac5D.gif)

You can set as many questions as you desire and staff can be assigned either with a permission (default is  ban members) or by setting a staff role.

<h1 align="center">Commands</h1>

All commands start with a prefix and by default the prefix is set to s!. This can be changed in the settings.js file.

**s!ping**
> Pong! Shows you have fast I am responding.

**s!help** 
> Pretty much just links to this repo which is where you can find the instructions.

**s!support @User/ID**
> This command either adds or removes the support role from the provided user. This command can only be run by staff.
